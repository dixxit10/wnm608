			<p class="mt-3" style="font-weight:bold">How to pack right, pitch your tent, cook a meal, sleep well and have fun.</p>
			<p>Camping is exciting and messy and even a little uncomfortable. But there’s fun in that change of pace from the “real world,” which, of course, is ironic because there’s little in this world more “real” than abandoning the creature comforts of home. When we venture outside, we often discover what we’re made out of—and that’s usually more than we thought.

				You can travel far, deep in the deepest woods, or a few feet out your back door. You can go with a group or alone. Sleep in a tent, a car, a cabin or on the dirt. Pack a lot or pack a little. There’s no wrong way to do it.

				Not sure where to start? We’re here for you. Below, check out our editors’ hard-earned tips on planning, setting up, sleeping well, eating better and having fun.</p>

			
			<p class="mt-3" style="font-weight:bold">Don’t Forget Anything</p>
			<p>These key essentials make for a cozy home away from home. For a full, detailed packing list, check out our Expert Advice Camping Checklist.

				<li>Make sure you’ve packed your tent with its rainfly, footprint, stakes and a hammer. Practice pitching at home or in the backyard first to make sure you know how and that you’ve got all the pieces.</li>
				<li>Choose a sleeping bag with a temperature rating lower than the lowest temperature you expect. A sheet or liner can add warmth (and time between washes).</li>
				<li>A sleeping pad not only helps soften your sleep but also insulates you from the cold ground, keeping you warmer at night.</li>
				<li>You’ll want to illuminate your campsite (and the route to the bathroom) after dark with a lantern, headlamp or flashlight. Pack extra batteries.</li>
				<li>Check the night’s low temperature and day’s high and pack clothes and toiletries for those, preparing for huge swings. Don’t forget a rain shell, hat, gloves and socks.</li>
				<li>Replenish used items in your first-aid kit like bandages and tape. Tweezers are more important than you’d think.</li>

			<p class="mt-3" style="font-weight:bold">Where Should I Go?</p>
			<p>Learn the differences among the country’s most prominent land types to help plan your dream trip. Reminder: Check ahead for area and facility closures.
				<li>NATIONAL PARKS These federally managed, recreation-oriented crown jewels typically feature developed campgrounds that are often booked well in advance. (Some parks may reserve sites for walk-ins, and others have primitive or dispersed camping.) Usually a great choice for scenery and for families; limited allowance for dogs.</li>
				<li>NATIONAL FORESTS AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (BLM) LAND Also managed by the federal government, these two land types allow “multiple use”—think logging, mining and grazing—in addition to recreation. Both feature some reservable designated campgrounds and lots of free dispersed camping, some of which can be incredible.</li>
				<li>STATE AND LOCAL PARKS These locally managed areas are usually gorgeous, though they’re rarely as  spectacular as a national park. There are more than 8,500 state parks in the U.S., with more than 200,000 campsites, many of which can be booked ahead of time or even the day before.</li>
				<li>PRIVATE PROPERTY This includes privately owned campgrounds and RV parks, with many near popular national parks and forests. Hipcamp is a great resource for finding and reserving private lands campsites nationwide (and worldwide).</li>
				<li>YOUR BACKYARD Hey, still counts. And there’s no fee.</li>
